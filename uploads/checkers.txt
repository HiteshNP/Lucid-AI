This lecture introduces you to only these protocols, but if you need to know this kind of
understanding will be sufficient for you to go ahead with the further lectures. But, in case you
need to go ahead these are some of these references that are listed which you can go through
in further detail and gain even more in depth, an understanding if you require to. 
Thank you.
