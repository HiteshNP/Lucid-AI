In the vast expanse of the cosmos, humanity has always been captivated by the mysteries of the universe. From the twinkling stars that decorate the night sky to the profound questions about the origins and fate of the universe, the cosmos has sparked curiosity and wonder in every corner of human civilization. The universe, with its boundless dimensions and enigmatic phenomena, challenges our understanding and invites us to explore its depths.

The universe began with the Big Bang, a monumental event that marked the birth of space and time approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This explosive event set in motion the expansion of the universe and led to the formation of the first atoms, which eventually coalesced to form stars and galaxies. The early universe was a hot, dense place, filled with a primordial soup of particles and radiation. As it expanded and cooled, the first elements—hydrogen and helium—were created, paving the way for the formation of the first stars.
